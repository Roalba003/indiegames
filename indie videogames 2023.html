<h2 style="background-color:Lavender;">Adventure Games</h2>
<p>In today's article our topic is adventure video games as is well known, indie adventure games have become widely known and widespread
Before I suggest you some indie videogames let's talk about what exactly indie video games are:
An indie game, short for independent video game, is a video game typically created by individuals or smaller development teams without the financial and technical support of a large game publisher, in contrast to most (triple-A) games.</p>
<h2 style="background-color:Lavender;">Creative freedom</h2>
<p>The most important factor in the eyes of big-name publishers is how much money your game is likely to make. As an indie dev, money doesn't have to be the sole motivation behind your project.
It doesn’t matter what kind of game you’ve got in mind - you can experiment with a silly or creative premise, and make the game you want to make just for the joy of making it.</p>
